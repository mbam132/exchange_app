This is an Exchange app for calculating the rate and the amount received from a crypto exchange. It has been initially implemented for the web.

## 👨🏼‍💻 Things implemented

- Selecting the fiat and the crypto currency.
- Enter the amount you want to do the exchange.
- The app displays: 1. the exchange rate, 2.the amount to receive, and 3. the estimated time.
- A "Do the exchange" button, that will, in the future, perform the exchange. Now it just displays a loading spinner.
